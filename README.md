<h1>Integrated Feature Selection and Optimization Framework for Predicting Student Learning Effectiveness and Performance</h1>
<p><b>Overview</b></p>
<p>This repository presents an integrated framework for feature selection and optimization aimed at enhancing student performance prediction. The proposed approach, UniSelect, combines filter and wrapper-based methods to select the most relevant features while eliminating redundancy, improving classification accuracy, and optimizing computational efficiency</p>
<p><b>Contributions</b></p>
<p><ol>UniSelect Algorithm: A hybrid feature selection method that integrates Chi-square and Feature Importance ranking techniques with Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE).</ol></p>
<p><ol>MMFW-RFE: An advanced optimization technique that refines UniSelect’s selected features using Reduced Recursive Feature Elimination and Cross-Validation-based Recursive Feature Elimination.</ol></p>
<p><ol>EMPA-FWO-VCA: An ensemble voting classifier that leverages Decision Tree (DT), Naïve Bayes (NB), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) for improved classification accuracy.</ol></p>
<p><b>Applications</b></p>
<p><ol>Student Performance Prediction – Identifies at-risk students and improves academic interventions to enhance learning outcomes.</ol></p>
<p><ol>Adaptive Learning Systems – Personalizes e-learning experiences by recommending tailored study materials and strategies.</ol></p>
<p><ol>Career Guidance & University Admissions – Assists in evaluating student potential for university admissions and career recommendations.</ol></p>
<p><ol>Educational Policy & Institutional Planning – Supports data-driven decision-making for curriculum design and resource allocation.</ol></p>
<p><ol>Workforce Development & Skill Training – Optimizes corporate training programs by predicting employee learning effectiveness.</ol></p>
<p><b>Prerequisites for Using the Framework</b></p>
<p><ol>Python Environment

Python 3.7 or later
Recommended: Anaconda or a virtual environment (venv)</ol></p>

<p><ol>Required Libraries 

NumPy
Pandas
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib
Seaborn</ol></p>

<p><ol>Dataset

The framework is designed to work with student performance datasets.
Ensure the dataset is in CSV format and contains relevant features like demographic, academic, and behavioral attributes.</ol></p>


<p><ol>Machine Learning Frameworks

Scikit-learn for feature selection and classification algorithms
TensorFlow/Keras (optional) for deep learning-based extensions</ol></p>




<p><ol>System Requirements

Minimum: 8GB RAM, Dual-Core CPU
Recommended: 16GB RAM, GPU for faster computations</ol></p>


<p><b>UniSelect Algorithm Workflow</b></p>
<P><ol>Input Data Preparation

Load dataset with n features and a target variable.
Define k1 (Chi-Square top-k features) and k2 (Feature Importance top-k features)<ol>.
<p><ol>Filter-Based Feature Selection

Chi-Square Test: Selects k1 most relevant features (C).
Extra Trees Classifier (ETC): Computes feature importance using MDI & MDA, selecting k2 top features (I).</ol></p>
<p><ol>Feature Combination & Refinement

Compute custom scoring metrics (S).
Identify and remove highly correlated features (R).
Form the Modified Union Set = C ∪ I ∪ S ∩ R.</ol></p>
<p><ol>Wrapper-Based Optimization

Apply Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) to refine the selected feature subset.</ol></p>
<p><ol>Final Model Training & Prediction

Train a classifier (SVM, DT, NB, etc.) on optimized features.
Predict student performance with improved accuracy.</ol></p>
