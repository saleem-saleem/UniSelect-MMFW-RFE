<h1>Integrated Feature Selection and Optimization Framework for Predicting Student Learning Effectiveness and Performance</h1>
<p><b>Overview</b></p>
<p>This repository presents an integrated framework for feature selection and optimization aimed at enhancing student performance prediction. The proposed approach, UniSelect, combines filter and wrapper-based methods to select the most relevant features while eliminating redundancy, improving classification accuracy, and optimizing computational efficiency</p>
<p><b>Contributions</b></p>
<p><ol>UniSelect Algorithm: A hybrid feature selection method that integrates Chi-square and Feature Importance ranking techniques with Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE).</ol></p>
<p><ol>MMFW-RFE: An advanced optimization technique that refines UniSelect’s selected features using Reduced Recursive Feature Elimination and Cross-Validation-based Recursive Feature Elimination.</ol></p>
<p><ol>EMPA-FWO-VCA: An ensemble voting classifier that leverages Decision Tree (DT), Naïve Bayes (NB), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) for improved classification accuracy.</ol></p>
<p><b>Applications</b></p>
<p><ol>Student Performance Prediction – Identifies at-risk students and improves academic interventions to enhance learning outcomes.</ol></p>
<p><ol>Adaptive Learning Systems – Personalizes e-learning experiences by recommending tailored study materials and strategies.</ol></p>
<p><ol>Career Guidance & University Admissions – Assists in evaluating student potential for university admissions and career recommendations.</ol></p>
<p><ol>Educational Policy & Institutional Planning – Supports data-driven decision-making for curriculum design and resource allocation.</ol></p>
<p><ol>Workforce Development & Skill Training – Optimizes corporate training programs by predicting employee learning effectiveness.</ol></p>
<p><b>Prerequisites for Using the Framework</b></p>
<p><ol>Python Environment

Python 3.7 or later
Recommended: Anaconda or a virtual environment (venv)</ol></p>
